## Abstract

**Millennium Prize Problems of CEST MRI**
The Millennium Prize Problems, announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, represent seven of the most challenging unsolved problems in mathematics, each carrying a reward of $1 million for a correct solution. These problems include the P vs NP Problem, Hodge Conjecture, Poincar√© Conjecture (solved by Grigori Perelman in 2003), Riemann Hypothesis, Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap, Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness, and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.

In this session, we draw a parallel between these foundational mathematical challenges and the big questions facing the field of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CEST MRI). Just as the Millennium Problems represent the frontiers of mathematical knowledge, we should explore the critical, yet unresolved, questions that could drive significant advancements in CEST MRI.

Impact of each suggested problem needs to be discussed.
This session aims to inspire attendees to consider these big, unsolved problems and collaborate on innovative solutions, potentially leading to breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding and application of CEST MRI, and in medical science.
