# CEST-conference-2024
Materials and  Q&amp;A for the CEST conference 2024 Nürnberg, Germany 

We suggest three reviewers per abstract, meaning everybody needs to review around 20 abstracts (assistants welcome, if you approve)
I added Jan Schüre and Patrick Schünke from my local committee to the reviewers list, if you approve, this yields then 5 reviewer groups. 
I mixed the Revs 1-3 a bit for continent, gender, and experience, so every abstract gets a good mix of reviewers.
The abstract groups are just alphabetically, which is probably random enough.

	         
    Abstracts #	Rev 1:	            Rev 2:	            Rev 3:
    1-20	      
    21-40	     
    41-60	     
    61-80	      
    81-99	      

You will get an excel file listing the 20 abstracts you have to review. (See an example excel file attached, please check it and especially the grading categories and system)
Abstracts are identified by an ID (#001-#099) and the original file name. 
You will then also get access to a combined PDF containing all abstracts, also identified by the same ID and the original file names. 
So you can find and review all the abstracts from your list and add the grades in the excel file. 
In the case of own abstracts or other conflicts of interest, just select “Rev. conflict -  yes”, and leave the abstract ungraded. 
Once you are finished, send your grade table back to cestworkshopinfo@gmail.com with your reviewer number in the subject. 
Best before 10th of June, so we can compile everything for our second meeting at 11th of June. 


Suggestions to improve these instructions and the process are very welcome.
